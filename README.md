### About MovieBrowser

Hi! My name is Eric Chen and this was my first project working with the NextJS framework, and I experimented with using it to create a simple movie browsing website using The Movie DataBase's API.

### Progress

The home page is a placeholder for whatever important information I may decide to add later on.

In order to search for a movie, the user can go to the search tab, input a keyword, and the page will update with all movies relevant to that keyword.

Currently, I have not yet implemented the Gallery page, so there is a temporary landing page put in place.  My plans for this are to implement a gallery view of randomly selected movies, along with their ratings at a glance.  The visitor then can click on the image and will be redirected to a webpage containing more details on the movie.

With this, I also plan to implement a filter feature, in which the user can set filters to narrow down the selection of movies in both the Gallery view and the Search view.

I also have plans to expand my knowledge into the backend, including databasing and implementation of GraphQL.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
