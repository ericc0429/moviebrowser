### About MovieBrowser

Hi! My name is Eric Chen and this was my first project working with the NextJS framework, and I experimented with using it to create a simple movie browsing website using The Movie DataBase's API.


### Progress

The home page is a placeholder for whatever information I may decide to add later on.

In order to search for a movie, the user can go to the search tab, input a keyword, and the page will update with all movies relevant to that keyword.


### To-Do

Add clickable links to items in "Now Trending" Section.
Filter feature for "Search".

Further down the line: Exploration into databasing on my own, implementation of GraphQL.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
